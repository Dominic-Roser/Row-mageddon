# Row-mageddon
Strap in, grab your oars, and prepare for the most unhinged rowing experience of your life! Oar-mageddon is the only rowing simulator where sportsmanship is optional, and chaos is mandatory.

In this high-octane, absurd competitive rowing experience, you’ll race against rival crews in scenic locations—like a lava river, a whirlpool-ridden pirate cove, and the perilous Swamp of Regret. But don’t expect a fair race—because this sport comes with power-ups.

**FEATURES:**

**1.  Customizable Boats & Crews** – Customize your team with the drip that you know they deserve (or don't), and pick from a selection of ludicrous boats-including whales, submarines and dragons!

**2.  Weaponized Rowing** – It’s not just about speed—it’s about survival. Blast rival teams with cannons, use a fishing rod to reel them back, and shield yourself with forcefields! If they’re too far ahead? Just toss a beer bottle to slow them down.

**3.  Dynamic Chaos** – Waves, whirlpools, krakens, and even angry swan gangs will make sure no race ever goes as planned. Be prepared to improvise when your boat catches fire (again).

**4.  Story Mode**: The Quest for the Golden Oar – Go from a lowly amateur to an aquatic warlord, taking on increasingly ridiculous teams, including pirates, oversized shrimp and even the Boys in the Boat.
If you ever wanted a rowing simulator with unhinged tactics and pure fun, Oar-mageddon is the game for you. Paddle fast, fire faster!


# Instructions for Unity Setup

1. Clone the Repo into a folder of your choice 

2. `git pull` in `main` to be sure you are up to date. (`git show` will show you which branch you are in)

3. Either create your own branch with `git branch <your branch name>`

or open a previously published branch with `git checkout <branch name>`.

4. Open the project on Unity by opening Unity Hub and then selecting "Add project from disk"

or select the project in your projects list if you've already added it.

**Now you're all set-up! Be sure to review rules if you're unsure how to push to production**

# Rules 

1. You are not allowed to directly make commits to main! Create a feature branch and you may make commits within that branch!

2. To push to main you must make a pull request first! Once you are done working with your branch and have made your last commit, open Github
and then open a pull request comparing main with your branch under the pull requests tab.

3. One approving review is required per pull request before merging with main. 

4. When modifying scenes in Unity, be sure that you have made your own scene to work within and titled it with your name as part of the name of the scene (once we are far enough along we will create scenes that are directly for production). **Many issues arise due to people simultaneously working on the same scene so PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't do it**

5. Maintain file structure and put the types of files in the folders in which they belong in.

6. Pull often and make sure that when you commit that whatever you've committed works, and that you are commiting to your own branch.

If you have any questions about anything above ask Dom he's so good at responding i promise.
