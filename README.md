# Row-mageddon
Strap in, grab your oars, and prepare for the most unhinged rowing experience of your life! Oar-mageddon is the only rowing simulator where sportsmanship is optional, and chaos is mandatory.

In this high-octane, absurd competitive rowing experience, you’ll race against rival crews in scenic locations—like a lava river, a whirlpool-ridden pirate cove, and the perilous Swamp of Regret. But don’t expect a fair race—because this sport comes with power-ups.

**FEATURES:**

***1.  Customizable Boats & Crews** – Customize your team with the drip that you know they deserve (or don't), and pick from a selection of ludicrous boats-including whales, submarines and dragons!

**2.  Weaponized Rowing** – It’s not just about speed—it’s about survival. Blast rival teams with cannons, use a fishing rod to reel them back, and shield yourself with forcefields! If they’re too far ahead? Just toss a beer bottle to slow them down.

**3.  Dynamic Chaos** – Waves, whirlpools, krakens, and even angry swan gangs will make sure no race ever goes as planned. Be prepared to improvise when your boat catches fire (again).

**4.  Story Mode**: The Quest for the Golden Oar – Go from a lowly amateur to an aquatic warlord, taking on increasingly ridiculous teams, including pirates, oversized shrimp and even the Boys in the Boat.
If you ever wanted a rowing simulator with unhinged tactics and pure fun, Oar-mageddon is the game for you. Paddle fast, fire faster!
